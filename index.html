   <h3>WHAT A CHARACTER!</h3>
   <P>Nelson Mandela,was an impeccable man and fascinatingly modest in his approach to the Presidency in contrast to the ill treatment he was subjected to,including hard labour that he endured while in prison.<br /><br />The outgoing white minority government when he became President was weary of the governemt policies he was going to put in place thinking,they were going to be vindictive with vengeance,but he turned a new leaf advocating for a truthful reconciliation for a unified South Africa.</p>
